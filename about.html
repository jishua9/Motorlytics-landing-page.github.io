                    <h2 class="feature-title">Our Mission</h2>
                    <p class="feature-description">We're on a mission to bring racing data analytics and professional-grade tools to racers of all levels ‚Äì from weekend warriors to professional teams.</p>
                    <p>For too long, effective race data analysis has been limited to those with big budgets and technical expertise. Motorlytics changes that by offering an intuitive platform that connects setup choices, weather conditions, and race results to help everyone make smarter decisions on track.</p>

                    <h2 class="feature-title">How It All Started</h2>
                    <p class="feature-description">Motorlytics began when we found ourselves struggling to remember which setup worked at which track under specific conditions. We had tried writing it on setup sheets, like many others have done over the years, but it was a pain to keep track of and find when needed.</p>
                    <p>After a particularly frustrating race weekend where old setup notes couldn't be found and weather conditions changed dramatically, we realized there had to be a better way to track and correlate all the variables that impact race performance. We looked at the top tier racing leagues and saw that they all had advanced data analytics tools to help them improve their performance.
                        aswell as pit wall systems showing them the weather, time to their sessions, results, and more. Looking at these expansive solutions we thought to ourselves, why not bring this to the amateur racing community, but at an affordable price?
                        Top tools shouldnt be restricted to the top tier racing leagues, and we wanted to make sure that amateur racers had the same tools to improve their performance.</p>
                    <p>Building this on features we needed over the race weekends and what helped us improve our performance, the first version of Motorlytics was born in 2023. What began as a simple tool for tracking setups quickly evolved into a comprehensive platform for race performance optimization as more racers discovered its benefits.</p>
